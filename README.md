# Elementary school website
A new website for an elementary school aimed at modernizing an outdated version that was over 10 years old. The new site was designed with a focus on a simple and clear layout, making it easy to use for parents, teachers, and students. A key feature was responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile devices. Additionally, the website includes an automatic gallery generation function from uploaded images, making it easier for the school to share photos from events and activities.
